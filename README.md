## The Problem

Shopping online means browsing through lists, applying filters, comparing specs, and still not being sure. AI shopping assistants today are glorified search bars with a chat interface — they find products, but they don't help you decide.

ShopMind replaces the entire browse-search-filter-compare loop with a single conversation. It understands what the buyer actually needs, narrows intelligently through one smart question at a time, recommends with a confidence score and plain-English reason, and supports a clean one-tap path to purchase — without showing a single product list.

**The gap ShopMind fills:** the decision layer of commerce — the moment between "I want something" and "I bought it" — is owned by nobody today.

## 11 Integrated Logics

| Logic | Feature | What it satisfies |
|-------|---------|------------------|
| L1 | Emotional intent parser | Understand what the user actually needs |
| L2 | One-question progressive narrowing | Narrow options intelligently |
| L3 | Dimension-aware comparison card | Compare products on what matters |
| L4 | Confidence score + plain-English reason | Explain recommendations clearly |
| L5 | One-tap cart (no redirect) | Clean path to checkout |
| L6 | Mood canvas (non-verbal entry) | Originality — zero typing required |
| L7 | Persona-matched social proof | Build trust naturally |
| L8 | Regret prevention before checkout | Reduce returns |
| L9 | Silent upsell (experience framing) | Higher AOV without pushiness |
| L10 | Recipient shadow profile + return banner | LTV and repeat purchase engine |
| L11 | Merchant insights dashboard at /insights | Commerce infrastructure signal |

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Free Shopify Partner account → [partners.shopify.com](https://partners.shopify.com)
- Free Groq API key → [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com)

### 1. Clone and install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dbeediv/shopmind.git
cd shopmind
npm install
```

### 2. Configure environment
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Fill in your values — see .env.example for instructions
```

Required values:
```
SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN=shopmind-a48eho1s.myshopify.com
SHOPIFY_ADMIN_ACCESS_TOKEN=shpat_xxxx
SHOPIFY_API_VERSION=2024-01
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development
SESSION_SECRET=

GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_xxxx
```

**Shopify Admin API scopes needed:**
`read_products`, `write_products`, `write_draft_orders`, `read_draft_orders`, `read_inventory`

> Why Admin API (not Storefront)? The Storefront API doesn't expose custom metafields.
> Our entire intelligence layer lives in metafields. See Decision D01 in DECISION_LOG.md.

### 3. Create metafield definitions (run once)
```bash
npm run setup
```

### 4. Seed the product catalog (run once)
```bash
npm run seed
```
Creates 40 curated gifting products with full ShopMind metafield architecture:
`emotion_tags`, `persona`, `occasion`, `mood_tiles`, `social_proof`, `complementary`, `regret_objection`, `regret_answer`

### 5. Start
```bash
npm start
```

- Buyer interface: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- Merchant insights: [http://localhost:3000/insights](http://localhost:3000/insights)
